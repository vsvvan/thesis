\section{Adaptive neuro‑fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)}
An adaptive network is a multi-layer feedforward network in which each node performs a particular
function (node function) on incoming signals as well as a set of parameters pertaining to this node. The nature
of the node functions may vary from node to node, and the choice of each node function depends on the overall
input-output function which the adaptive network is required to carry out.

ANFIS represent Sugeno Takagi fuzzy models and uses a hybrid learning algorithm. For simplicity, we assume the fuzzy inference system under consideration has two inputs x and y and one output z. Suppose that the rule base contains two fuzzy if-then rules of Takagi and Sugeno’s type:


Rule 1: If \(x\) is \(A1\) and \(y\) is \(B1\), then \(f1 = p1\ x + q1\ y + r1\);

Rule 2: If \(x\) is \(A2\) and \(y\) is \(B2\), then \(f2 = p2\ x + q2\ y + r\).
