This master's thesis discusses the process of designing and developing a fuzzy expert system for multi-agent simulation of a predator-prey game that chases prey. To improve the accuracy of the system's results, additional training of the multi-agent system was performed using artificial intelligence training methods in the Matlab environment, which represent predators and prey as autonomous agents using their own rules to navigate in the "forest" environment depending on the situation around them and the provided rule system.

The expert system was designed and implemented in Matlab using the Fuzzy logic designer and the Simulink extension. The system uses a set of fuzzy rules that have knowledge about the world and decide which action is most appropriate to perform at a given moment. And Simulink allows you to model multi-agent systems in a closed environment for fixed periods of time.
