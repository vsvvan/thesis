\section{Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox}

Fuzzy Logic Toolbox provides a range of useful features for MATLAB users, including functions, apps, and a Simulink block for analyzing, designing, and simulating fuzzy logic systems. The product enables you to configure inputs, outputs, membership functions, and rules of both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy inference systems with ease. Additionally, automatic membership function and rule tuning is available to you. Evaluate the created fuzzy logic systems in MATLAB and Simulink, or utilize the fuzzy inference system as a support system to explain AI-based black-box models.\cite{UserGuide}
