% nejaky obkec o tom ze data sa ziskavaju cez teleskopy a tie maju CCD chipy a ze snimky su vo formate FITS. a potom ze v tejto casti prejdeme rozne features ktore sa na snimkach nachadzaju, scenare a defekty a ako tieto nezaduce data odstranujeme
% FITS frames
% AGO data

Many of the most interesting dynamics in nature have to do with interactions between organisms. These interactions are often subtle, indirect, and difficult to detect. Interactions in which one organism consumes all or part of another. This includes predator-prey, herbivore-plant, and parasite-host interactions. These linkages are the prime movers of energy through food chains. They are an important factor in the ecology of populations, determining the mortality of prey and the birth of new predators.

A connected system of predator and prey should cycle, according to mathematical models and common sense: predators grow in number when prey is abundant, predation reduces prey populations to low levels, predator numbers fall, and prey populations rise indefinitely. The Lotka-Volterra Model is one such model that mimics predator-prey interactions.
