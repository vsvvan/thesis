\section{Fuzzy sets}


Fuzzy logic, a mathematical theory for uncertainty, was introduced by Zadeh in 1965 as an extension of boolean logic, based on the mathematical theory of fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic allows for a condition to be in a state other than just true or false by introducing the concept of degree in the verification process. This enables the consideration of inaccuracies and uncertainties, giving reasoning a valuable degree of flexibility. One of the many benefits of fuzzy logic is its ability to formalize human reasoning through natural language-based rules. Fuzzy systems are designed to emulate human reasoning processes, and if-then rules are used to represent relationships explicitly.
